# RotorHazard
FPV Race Timing and Event Management

A multi-node radio frequency race timing system for FPV drone racing, with event management. Uses 5.8GHz video signals broadcast by drones to trigger lap times. Each node listens on a specified frequency and communicates times to a central server (raspberry pi). The server manages a front-end interface, which any device on the same network can connect to via web browser.

RotorHazard builds on the [Delta5 Race Timer](https://github.com/scottgchin/delta5_race_timer), and supports up to 8 nodes.

## Major Features
* Timing and event management on local server hardware
* Modern, mobile-friendly, and responsive
* Confidently calibrate in seconds with visual interface
* Fix calibration issues retroactively after race is complete
* Never miss a lap; recover laps with full accuracy by reviewing RSSI history
* Improved filtering works both indoors and outdoors without adjustment, even in difficult multipathing environments
* Improved synchronization and timing accuracy
* Manage pilots, heats, classes, and race formats
* Full manual control of results for race organizer
* Statistics broken out by event, class, heat, and round
* Sends realtime lap data to livetime
* LED and audio support to indicate race staging, starts, and other events
* JSON API to retrieve timing data from other systems

## Hardware and Software Setup
To build and configure the system, follow the instructions here:<br />
[doc/Hardware Setup.md](doc/Hardware%20Setup.md)<br />
[doc/Software Setup.md](doc/Software%20Setup.md)

An easy-to-build single node version of RotorHazard may also be constructed -- see [doc/USB Nodes.md](doc/USB%20Nodes.md) for more info.

**Note:** The 'master' branch in the GitHub repository will usually contain the latest development code, which may not be stable. To install the latest stable release, please follow the instructions in the [doc/Software Setup.md](doc/Software%20Setup.md) document (for version upgrading see the '[Updating an existing installation](doc/Software%20Setup.md#update)' section at the end).

## User Guide
For initial setup and running races, follow these instructions: [doc/User Guide.md](doc/User%20Guide.md)

## Migrating from/to Delta5
RotorHazard uses the same hardware, but different code for the nodes. Re-flash your Arduinos as in the [setup instructions](doc/Software%20Setup.md#receiver-nodes-arduinos) whenever you switch between the two projects.

## Additional Resources
Links to external resources are available from the [Wiki](https://github.com/RotorHazard/RotorHazard/wiki), including extended tutorials, video content, and a Raspberry Pi setup/install/upgrade/node flashing tool.
