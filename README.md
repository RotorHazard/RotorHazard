# RotorHazard
FPV Race Timing and Event Management

A multi-node radio frequency race timing system for FPV drone racing, with event management. Uses 5.8GHz video signals broadcast by drones to trigger lap times. Each node listens on a specified frequency and communicates times to a central server (raspberry pi). The server manages a front-end interface, which any device on the same network can connect to via web browser.

RotorHazard builds on the [Delta5 Race Timer](https://github.com/scottgchin/delta5_race_timer), and supports up to 8 nodes.

## Major Features
* Race timing and event management on local hardware, no internet connection needed
* Full screen and mobile-friendly responsive interface
* Confidently calibrate in seconds using visual interface
* Adjust and apply calibration retroactively after race is complete
* Learns which calibration values work for each pilot and automatically applies them to new races
* Never miss a lap; recover laps with full accuracy by reviewing race history
* Advanced signal filtering allows accurate reading both indoors and outdoors, even in difficult multipathing environments
* Accurately tracks analog and DJI HD video transmitters
* Manage pilots, heats, classes, and race formats
* Statistics broken out by event, class, heat, and round
* Generates overlay displays and results pages for use with live streaming software such as OBS
* Timer hardware synchronized with user interface for accurate start/end signals with compensation for poor network connectivity
* LED and audio support to indicate race staging, starts, and other events
* Sends live updates of lap times and split times to pilot OSD
* Control connected video receivers; change frequency and view lock status
* Connect other systems to extend functionality via MQTT or JSON API
* Sends realtime lap data to LiveTime

## Hardware and Software Setup
To build and configure the system, follow the instructions here:<br />
[doc/Hardware Setup.md](doc/Hardware%20Setup.md)<br />
[doc/Software Setup.md](doc/Software%20Setup.md)

View the RotorHazard documentation here: [doc/README.md](doc/README.md)

An easy-to-build single node version of RotorHazard may also be constructed -- see [doc/USB Nodes.md](doc/USB%20Nodes.md) for more info.

**Note:** The 'master' branch in the GitHub repository will usually contain the latest development code, which may not be stable. To install the latest stable release, please follow the instructions in the [doc/Software Setup.md](doc/Software%20Setup.md) document (for version upgrading see the '[Updating an existing installation](doc/Software%20Setup.md#update)' section at the end).

## User Guide
For initial setup and running races, follow these instructions: [doc/User Guide.md](doc/User%20Guide.md)

## Migrating from/to Delta5
RotorHazard uses the same hardware, but different code for the nodes. Re-flash your Arduinos as in the [setup instructions](doc/Software%20Setup.md#receiver-nodes-arduinos) whenever you switch between the two projects.

## Additional Resources
Links to external resources are available from the [Wiki](https://github.com/RotorHazard/RotorHazard/wiki), including extended tutorials, video content, and a Raspberry Pi setup/install/upgrade/node flashing tool.
