# Delta 5 Race Timer

### Description:

Multi-node video RF race timer for drone racing.  This timing system uses the video signals being broadcast by FPV racing drones to trigger a lap timer; no additional equipment required on the drone. Each receiver node is tuned to the video frequency that a drone is broadcasting on.  One receiver node is required for each frequency being tracked.  All of the receiver nodes are connected to a raspberry pi, which aggregates the data and also provides a simple GUI for the race director.

This is the description for the 6 Receiver Node version, but you can add as many Receiver Nodes as you like and the code will need to be modified accordingly.
