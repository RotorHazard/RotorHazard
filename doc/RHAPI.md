## Introduction

Most plugin interfaces provide access to `RHAPI`, an object providing a wide range of properties and methods across RotorHazard's internal systems. Using RHAPI, one can manipulate nearly every facet of a race event and RotorHazard's behavior.

### API Version

The API version can be read from the `API_VERSION_MAJOR` and `API_VERSION_MINOR` properties.

### Language translation shortcut

The language translation function can be accessed directly via `RHAPI.__()` in addition to its location within `RHAPI.language`.



## Standard Events

Significant timer actions trigger *events*. Plugin authors may bind *handler* functions to events which are run when the event occurs. Many timer subsystems trigger an initialize event so plugins can register behaviors within them. Plugin authors may also bind to and trigger custom events either for their own purposes or to share data between plugins.

A list of timer-provided events is contained within the `Evt` class in `/src/server/eventmanager.py`, which can be accessed with `from eventmanager import Evt`. 

For example, a plugin might register events to be run at startup like this:
```
from eventmanager import Evt

def initialize(rhapi):
    rhapi.events.on(Evt.STARTUP, my_startup_function)
```

### Standard Event Details and Usage

When an *event* is *triggered*, all registered *handlers* are run. *Events* may pass arguments containing useful data such as the node number, pilot callsign, or race object. All events return `args(dict)`, but the available keys will vary.

Register a *handler* using the `.on()` function, usually within your `initialize()` function.

Handlers are given a `name` during registration. One handler with each `name` can be registered per *event*; registering with the same `name` and `event` multiple times will cause handlers to be overridden. Providing a `name` is not needed in most circumstances, as one will be automatically generated if not provided. If multiple *handlers* need bound to the same `event` in one plugin, separate `name`s are required.

*Events* are registered with a *priority* that determines the order handlers are run, lower numbers first. Priorities < 100 are executed synchronously, blocking other code from executing until they finish. Priorities >= 100 are executed asynchronously, allowing the timer to continue running other code. Handlers should generally be run asynchronously, except initial registrations. **Python's `gevents` are not true threads, so code running asynchronously must call `gevent.idle` or `gevent.sleep` at frequent intervals to allow other parts of the server to execute.**

If run asynchronously (priority >= 100), a *handler* will cancel other *handlers* that have the same `name`. For example, only one LED effect can be visible at a time. Handler cancellation can also be prevented by setting a handler's `unique` property to `True`.


#### .on(event, handler_fn, default_args=None, priority=None, unique=False, name=None)
Registers a *handler* to an *event*. This causes the code in the *handler* to be run each time the *event* is *triggered* by any means (timer, plugin, or otherwise). No return.

- `event` (Evt|string): triggering *event* for this *handler*
- `handler_fn` (function): function to run when this event triggers
- `default_args` _optional_ (dict): provides default arguments for the handler; these arguments will be overridden if the `Event` provides arguments with the same keys.
- `priority` _optional_ (int): event priority, as detailed above; if not set, default priority is 75 (synchronous) for intial registrations and 200 (asynchronous) for all others
- `unique` _optional_ (boolean): if set to `True`, this *handler*'s thread will not be cancelled by other *handlers* with the same `name`
- `name` _optional_ (string): sets this handler's `name`; if left unset, the `name` is automatically generated from the module name of the plugin.

#### .off(event, name)

Removes a *handler* from an *event*. Removes only the specific `name` and `event` combination, so if *handlers* with the same `name` are registered to multiple `events`, others will not be removed. No return.

- `event` (string|Evt): the triggering *event* for this *handler*.
- `name` (string): the registered `name` of the handler to remove.

#### .trigger(event, evtArgs=None)

Triggers an *event*, causing all registered *handlers* to run

- `event` (string|Evt): the *event* to trigger
- `evtArgs` (dict): arguments to pass to the handler, overwriting matched keys in that handler's `default_args`

The sentinel value `RHUtils.HEAT_ID_NONE` should be used when no heat is defined.

NOTE: Results should be accessed with the `db.heat_results` method and not by reading the `results` property directly. The `results` property is unreliable because results calulation is delayed to improve system performance. `db.heat_results` ensures the calculation is current, will return quickly from cache if possible, or will build it if necessary.

- `heat_or_id` (int|heat): ID of heat to delete

#### db.heats_reset()
Delete all heat records. No return value.


### Heat &rarr; Slots
Slots are data structures containing a pilot assignment or assignment method. Heats contain one or more Slots corresponding to pilots who may participate in the Heat. When a heat is calculated, the `method` is used to reserve a slot for a given pilot. Afterward, `pilot` contains the ID for which the space is reserved. A Slot assignment is only a reservation, it does not mean the pilot has raced regardless of heat `status`.

Slots are represented with the `HeatNode` class, which has the following properties:
- `id` (int): Internal identifier

Import `ProgramMethod` with:
`from Database import ProgramMethod`

#### db.slots

All slot records. Returns `list[HeatNode]`.

#### db.slots_by_heat(heat_id)
Slot records associated with a specific heat. Returns `list[HeatNode]`.

With `method` set to `ProgramMethod.NONE`, most other fields are ignored. Only use `seed_heat_id` with `ProgramMethod.HEAT_RESULT`, and `seed_raceclass_id` with `ProgramMethod.CLASS_RESULT`, otherwise the assignment is ignored.

#### db.slots_alter_fast(slot_list)

### Race Classes
Race classes are groups of related heats. Classes may be used by the race organizer in many different ways, such as splitting sport and pro pilots, practice/qualifying/mains, primary/consolation bracket, etc.

Race classes are represented with the `RaceClass` class, which has the following properties:
- `id` (int): Internal identifier
- `name` (string): User-facing name
- `description` (string): User-facing long description, accepts markdown
- `format_id` (int): ID for class-wide required race format definition

Race formats are profiles of properties used to define parameters of individual races. Every race has an assigned format. A race formats may be assigned to a race class, which forces RotorHazard to switch to that formatwhen running races within the class.

Race formats are represented with the `RaceFormat` class, which has the following properties:
- `id` (int): Internal identifier
- `name` (string): User-facing name
- `unlimited_time` (int): True(1) if race clock counts up, False(0) if race clock counts down
- `race_time_sec` (int): Race clock duration in seconds, unused if `unlimited_time` is True(1)
- `lap_grace_sec` (int): Grace period duration in seconds, -1 for unlimited, unused if `unlimited_time` is True(1)
- `staging_fixed_tones` (int): Number of staging tones always played regardless of random delay
- `start_delay_min_ms` (int): Minimum period for random phase of staging delay in milliseconds
- `start_delay_max_ms` (int): Maximum duration of random phase of staging delay in milliseconds
- `staging_delay_tones` (int): Whether to play staging tones each second during random delay phase
- `number_laps_win` (int): Number of laps used to declare race winner, if > 0
- `win_condition` (int): Condition used to determine race winner and race ranking
- `team_racing_mode` (boolean): Whether local simultaneous team racing mode will be used
- `start_behavior` (int): Handling of first crossing
- `points_method` (String): JSON-serialized arguments for points algorithm

The sentinel value `RHUtils.FORMAT_ID_NONE` should be used when no race format is defined.

The following values are valid for `staging_delay_tones`.
- 0: None
- 2: Each Second

The following values are valid for `win_condition`.
- 0: None
- 1: Most Laps in Fastest Time
- 2: First to X Laps
- 3: Fastest Lap
- 4: Fastest Consecutive Laps
- 5: Most Laps Only
- 6: Most Laps Only with Overtime

The following values are valid for `start_behavior`.
- 0: Hole Shot
- 1: First Lap
- 2: Staggered Start

**Notice:** The race format specification is expected to be modified in future versions. Please consider this while developing plugins.
