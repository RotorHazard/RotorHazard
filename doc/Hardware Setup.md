## Hardware Setup

### RX5808 Video Receivers
Make sure your receivers support SPI. *Most RX5808 modules on sale today already arrive with SPI enabled.* If they do not, modify the RX5808 receivers to enable SPI support as follows:

Remove the shield from the RX5808, the shield is normally held on by a few spots of solder around the edges. Use some solder wick to remove the solder and free the shield from the receiver. Be careful not to damage any ground pads on the receiver. There are usually small holes around the edge you can use to help push off the shield.

Remove the following resistor:

The shield should be soldered back in place after removing the resistor.

### Receiver Nodes
Complete wiring connections between each Arduino and RX5808.

### System Assembly
Complete wiring connections between each Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.

Note: be sure all Receiver Nodes and the Raspberry Pi are tied to a common ground; if not, the i2c messages can be corrupted.

### Add a Directional RF Shield
A directional RF shield significantly improves the system's ability to reject false passes. This allows operators to increase its sensitivity or build courses that pass more closesly to the timing gate. Construct a directional shield that leaves a line of sight open between the timer and the timing gate, but blocks or attenuates RF signals from other directions. The most popular options to accomplish this are:
* Place the system inside a metal box with one side open, such as an ammo can, paint can, metal bucket, or computer case. It is recommended to attach this case to an electrical ground on the timer.
* Dig a hole into the ground and place your case within it
* Line your system case with copper tape

### WS2812b LED Support
The pins in the green box is what were already used by the timer. The pins in the red box is where you connect the signal and ground from the ws2812b LEDs.  The LEDs will require a separate power source. See WS2812b LED support under Software Setup.

### BME280 Temperature support (optional)
Attach to the I2C bus and 5V pins.
