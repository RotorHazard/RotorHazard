# Plugins Folder

Place your plugins here. Each plugin must have its own folder containing an `__init__.py` file. All plugins are auto-loaded into the server at startup. Plugins beginning with `rh_` are bundled with RotorHazard and may receive upgrades in future releases. Other folders are not tracked by Git and will not be destroyed in a Git-based server upgrade. Please ensure all plugins are compatible with the RotorHazard server version you are using.
